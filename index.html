<a name="cl-ctrie" class="anchor" href="#cl-ctrie"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CL-CTRIE</h1>

<p><strong>CL-CTRIE</strong> is a common-lisp implementation of the CTrie unordered map
data-structure described in the paper '<em>Concurrent Tries with
Efficient Non-Blocking Snapshots</em>, (c) ACM 2-25-2012' by Prokopec,
Bronson, Bagwell, and Odersky.</p>

<h3>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>A brief overview of general ctrie
concepts and existing implementations is available through its 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctrie">page on wikipedia</a>, of which the
following is a brief excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ctrie data structure is a non-blocking
concurrent hash array mapped trie based on
single-word compare-and-swap instructions in a
shared-memory system. It supports concurrent
LOOKUP, INSERT and REMOVE operations. Just like
the hash array mapped trie, it uses the entire
32-bit space for hash values thus having low
risk of hashcode collisions... Ctries have been
shown to be comparable in performance with
concurrent skip lists, concurrent hash tables
and similar data structures in terms of the
lookup operation...  However, they are far more
scalable than most concurrent hash tables where
the insertions are concerned. Most concurrent
hash tables are bad at conserving memory - when
the keys are removed from the hash table, the
underlying array is not [reduced in size]. Ctries
have the property that the allocated memory is
always a function of only the current number of
keys in the data-structure.  Ctries have logarithmic
complexity bounds of the basic operations...
with a low constant factor due to [large dispersal
ratio, (32^n arcs at level n)]. Ctries support a
lock-free, linearizable, constant-time SNAPSHOT
operation... This is a breakthrough in concurrent
data-structure design, since other existing concurrent
data-structures do not support snapshots. [This provides
the means to support features such as] lock-free,
linearizable iterator, size and clear operations. [This
is superior to other] existing concurrent data-structures
[which require the use of global locks [for exclusive,
blocking semantics for update access] permitting...
[no concurrent readers or writers] during any [update,
insert, remove or other modifications]. In particular,
Ctries have an O(1) ITERATOR creation operation, O(1)
CLEAR operation, O(1) DUPLICATE operation and an
amortized O(log n) operation for SIZE-RETRIEVAL.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="platform" class="anchor" href="#platform"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform</h3>

<p>Currently the lisp platform supported by cl-ctrie is SBCL version
1.0.55 or greater hosted on x86/x86-64 architecture. Support could
easily be entended to include other common-lisp implementations that
offer atomic compare-and-swap functionality, notably LispWorks
5.x/6.x, which is also well instrumented with lock-free, atomic
primitives, although this is not necessarily a high priority for the
initial development cycle.</p>

<h3>
<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h3>

<p>All tests should succeed; parallelism has been tested for 1,
2, 4, and 8 threads on an 8-core system (Dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
E5462 @ 2.80GHz), SBCL version 1.0.57.56-2273f3a, and Mac OS X Server
version 10.6.8.</p>

<a name="ideosyncrasies" class="anchor" href="#ideosyncrasies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ideosyncrasies</h3>

<p>Perhaps most ideosyncrasies of this common-lisp ctrie implementation
as compared with the <a href="http://github.com/axel22/Ctries">original</a>,
written in Scala, result from the efforts I have taken to, where
feasible, adopt an approach emphasizing a more functional oriented
decomposition of the algortithm, written in a manner that is more
closely representative of ideomatic, common-lisp coding style.  For
example, rather than expose a general purpose GCAS and RDCSS api,
these protocols are incorporated into ctrie-specific abstractions. For
<strong>GCAS</strong> the exposed api includes: <code>INODE-READ</code> <code>INODE-MUTATE</code> and
<code>INODE-COMMIT</code> and for <strong>RDCSS:</strong> <code>ROOT-NODE-ACCESS</code>
<code>ROOT-NODE-REPLACE</code> and <code>ROOT-NODE-COMMIT.</code> The liberties I have taken
have the intended benefit of providing an interface that is much
easier to digest, understand, remember, and work with (at least for
me) than direct exposure in imperative style of the intricate
mechanations that underlie the ctrie algorithm.  On the other hand,
the further one strays from a direct translation of the original
(verified) ctrie implementation, the greater the likelihood of
introducing bugs into an environment (lock-free concurrent data
structure development) in which bugs can be extremely subtle and
notoriously difficult to detect.  I have attempted to strike an
appropriate balance between these conflicting concerns, and I intend
to mitigate the risk, at least in part, through continued development
of an extensive arsenal of regression tests and benchmarking
facilities.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a few differences in the feature set that
is provided -- such as a suite of mapping operators in leiu of a
Java-style Iterator.  For the most part I expect that these
changes will be preferable to developers accustomed to a more
'lispy' coding style.</p>

<p>For additional insight into the specifics unique to this ctrie
implementation, an abbreviated reference to a number of internal
details may be found in the section <a href="Internal%0AReference">Internal Reference</a> of this document, or, of course, by referring to
the <a href="doc/api/index.html">comprehensive documentation</a> that is
provided as part of this distribution.</p>

<a name="performance" class="anchor" href="#performance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance</h3>

<p>To date, the principal concern has been to fully achieve a working
and robust implementation of the CTRIE algorithm, with only the
occaisional profiling run from time to time in order to at least
get a general sense of where the hot-spots are and peace of mind
that there are at least no glaring bottlenecks that seem out of
hand.  A basic profiling exercise of the following activities is
reported below.</p>

<pre><code>1. construct a new ctrie instance
2. perform one-million insertions of (fixnum) key/value pairs
3. perform one-million lookups verifying retrieval of every value
4. perform one-million removals verifying proper contraction of the structure
5. verify the resulting ctrie is identical to when initially created.

<p>The following sections provide a compact overview of the user api
and a reference to some internal definitions of interest.</p>

<h4>
<a name="user-api-reference" class="anchor" href="#user-api-reference"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User API Reference</h4>

<p>The user api of cl-ctrie should be largely familiar to the average
common-lisp programmer.  Nearly all exported symbols of the CL-CTRIE 
package begin with the prefix "ctrie" and thus can be convenientely
incorporated via USE-PACKAGE or equivalent package definition.  The
following definitions comprise a quick reference to the the public
user api:</p>

<hr><p><em>[structure]</em>        <code>CTRIE ()</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A CTRIE structure is the root container that uniquely identifies a CTRIE
  instance, and  contains the following perameters which specify the
  definable aspects of each CTRIE:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<code>READONLY-P</code> if not <code>NIL</code> prohibits any future modification or
cloning of this instance.</li>
<li>
<code>TEST</code> is a designator for an equality predicate that will be
applied to disambiguate and determine the equality of any two
keys. It is recommened that this value be a symbol that is fboundp,
to retain capability of externalization (save/restore). At present,
though, this is not enforced and a function object or lambda
expression will also be accepted, albeit without the ability of
save/restore.</li>
<li>
<code>HASH</code> is a designator for a hash function, which may be
desirable to customize when one has specific knowledge about the set
of keys which will populate the table.  At this time, a 32-bit hash
is recommended as this is what has been used for development and
testing and has been shown to provide good performance in
practice. As with <code>TEST</code> it is recommended that <code>HASH</code> be specified
by a symbol that is fboundp.</li>
<li>
<code>ROOT</code> is the slot used internally for storage of the root inode
structure that maintains the reference to the contents of the ctrie
proper.  The ctrie-root must only be accessed using the <em>RDCSS ROOT
NODE PROTOCOL</em> defined by the top-level entry-points <code>ROOT-NODE-ACCESS</code>
and <code>ROOT-NODE-REPLACE</code>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[function]</em>         <code>MAKE-CTRIE  (&amp;REST ARGS &amp;KEY NAME ROOT (READONLY-P NIL)
                                   (TEST 'EQUAL) (HASH 'SXHASH)
                                   &amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CREATE a new CTRIE instance. This is the entry-point constructor 
  intended for use by the end-user.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-P  (OBJECT)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Returns T if the specified object is of type ctrie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-TEST  (CTRIE)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Returns the test of the specified ctrie</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-HASH  (CTRIE)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Returns the hash of the specified ctrie</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-READONLY-P  (CTRIE)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Returns and (with setf) changes the readonly-p of the specified ctrie</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-PUT  (CTRIE KEY VALUE)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insert a new entry into CTRIE mapping KEY to VALUE.  If an entry
  with key equal to KEY aleady exists in CTRIE, according to the
  equality predicate defined by <code>CTRIE-TEST</code> then the priorbmapping
  will be replaced by VALUE. Returns <code>VALUE</code> representing the
  mapping in the resulting CTRIE</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-GET  (CTRIE KEY)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find the entry in CTRIE whose key is KEY and returns the
  associated value and T as multiple values, or returns NIL and NIL
  if there is no such entry. Entries can be added using SETF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-DROP  (CTRIE KEY)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remove KEY and it's associated value from CTRIE. Returns as multiple
  values the value associated with KEY and T if there was such an entry,
  otherewise NIL and NIL</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[macro]</em>            <code>CTRIE-DO  ((KEY VALUE CTRIE &amp;KEY ATOMIC) &amp;BODY BODY)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iterate over the contents of CTRIE in the manner of dolist. For each
  (key . value) pair present in CTRIE, BODY (implicit PROGN) will be
  evaluated with the symbols specified for KEY and VALUE will be bound
  to the respective entry constituents.  A special variable
  ACCUM (initially NIL) is available for accumulation of a result
  value which will be returned after the completion of the CTRIE-DO
  call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will be performed on a
  read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees a consistent,
  point-in-time representation of the entries present in CTRIE.</p>

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>CTRIE-MAP  (CTRIE FN &amp;KEY ATOMIC &amp;AUX ACCUM)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Applies a function two arguments, FN, to each (key . value) pair present in
  CTRIE.  During the extent of CTRIE-MAP, a special variable ACCUM (initially NIL)
  is available for accumulation of a result value which will be returned after
  the completion of the CTRIE-MAP call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will
  be performed on a read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees a

<blockquote>
<p>Define a 'functional' <strong>CTRIE-LAMBDA</strong> that combines all the the
  capabilities of the raw data structure with behavior and semantics
  one would expect of any other ordinary common-lisp function.  The
  resulting symbol defined as 'name will be bound in three distinct
  namespaces: the <code>SYMBOL-VALUE</code> will be bound to the LAMBDA CLOSURE
  object, <code>SYMBOL-FUNCTION</code> (fdefinition) will be FBOUND to the
  compiled function, and the corresponding '(SETF NAME) form will be
  SETF-BOUND.  the syntax for invoking NAME is as in a LISP1; i.e., no
  'funcall' is required (but still works if you prefer).
  Calling <code>(NAME key)</code> returns the value mapped to key, or <code>NIL</code> just
  as if by <code>(CTRIE-GET ctrie-name key).</code> Analogously when used as a
  setf-able place such as by <code>(setf (NAME key) value)</code> it has the
  equivalent behavior to the operation <code>(CTRIE-PUT ctrie-name key
  value).</code> Use of this type of binding technique has some really
  convenient effects that I've quickly started to become quite fond
  of.  One such idiom, for example, <code>(mapcar MY-CTRIE '(key1 key2 key3
  key4 ...))</code> returns a list containing all the mapped values
  corresponding to the respective keys.  One additional feature that
  I've found extremely useful is included <em>under the hood:</em> Invoking
  MY-CTRIE on an object of type FUNCTION will not search the ctrie for
  an entry having that function ast its key, but will instead APPLY
  that function to the actual CTRIE structure wrapped within the
  closure.  Thus, <code>(MY-CTRIE #'identity)</code> will return the underlying
  ctrie as just an ordinary instance of a CTRIE STRUCTURE.<br>
  There are many other functions this is handy with, like
  <code>(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-size)</code> <code>(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-to-hashtable)</code>
  etc.  Some additional examples are provided below.</p>

<ul>
<li>

cloning of this instance.</li>
<li>
<code>TEST</code> is a designator for an equality predicate that will be
applied to disambiguate and determine the equality of any two
keys. It is recommened that this value be a symbol that is fboundp,
to retain capability of externalization (save/restore). At present,
though, this is not enforced and a function object or lambda
expression will also be accepted, albeit without the ability of
save/restore.</li>
<li>
<code>HASH</code> is a designator for a hash function, which may be
desirable to customize when one has specific knowledge about the set
of keys which will populate the table.  At this time, a 32-bit hash
is recommended as this is what has been used for development and
testing and has been shown to provide good performance in
practice. As with <code>TEST</code> it is recommended that <code>HASH</code> be specified
by a symbol that is fboundp.</li>
<li>
<code>ROOT</code> is the slot used internally for storage of the root inode
structure that maintains the reference to the contents of the ctrie
proper.  The ctrie-root must only be accessed using the <em>RDCSS ROOT
NODE PROTOCOL</em> defined by the top-level entry-points <code>ROOT-NODE-ACCESS</code>

  <code>RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR</code> object which specifies in full the current state
  and all desired changes in the proposed resulting state.  Thus,
  whether any individual replacement attempt succeeds or fails, either
  result is guarenteed to represent a valid state. An attempt is then
  made to atomically swap this RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR with the current CTRIE
  root inode.  Note that, although it contains all of the information
  representing two, distinct, root inode states, the RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR
  is not, itself, a valid root inode.  That is the reason why all
  access to the root inode must be accomplished using this specialized

  inode completes successfully, <code>ROOT-NODE-COMMIT</code> is invoked which
  will attempt to complete the second step of this protocol.  The

  states defined in the RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object.  If another thread
  concurrently attempts access to a root node holding an
  RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object rather than an INODE, it will invoke

<p><em>[function]</em>         <code>%INSERT  (INODE KEY VALUE LEVEL PARENT STARTGEN)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> The detailed specifics required to perform an insertion into a
CTRIE map are defined by and contained within the <code>%INSERT</code> function,
which is not part of the USER API and should never be invoked
directly.  The procedures required for interaction with <code>%INSERT</code> are
managed entirely by the upper layer entry-points and should be
entirely invisible to the developer using CL-CTRIE.  The alogorithm is
intricate and requires quite some effort to figure out based on the
papers and documentation. For that reason this attempt is made to
properly document the process -- not to encourage anyone to fiddle
with it...</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>A given call to %insert carries with it no guarantee that it will
actually succeed.  Further, there is no guarantee it will do anything
at all -- including ever returning to the caller having invoked it.
This is because there are a number of circumstances that may possibly
interfere with insertion in a lock-free concurrent data-structure and
in order to minimize the cost incurred by aborted attempts and
restarts, there is no effort wasted on careful condition handling or
recovery.  Instead, as soon as it is recognised that a particular
attempt will not succeed, Control is thrown via non-local exit
unceremoneously the entire call stack and restarting each time from
the very beginning. There are quite a few places within the process
where you will find these nonlocal exits. Originally I had in mind to
incorporate some additional insrumentation to track and gather
statistics the log the specifics of all this, and there are a number
of extension points provided.  For more details refer to the
<code>MULTI-CATCH</code> and <code>CATCH-CASE</code> control structure documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>%insert ALWAYS begins at an INODE.  This is not surprising, of
course, since the root of the tree (where all inserts begin) is an
INODE, and because INODES are the only nodes that provide
mutability. When we which to effect change to the CTRIE regardless of
where or what type, It may only be accomplished by mutating the parent
INODE immediately above it to reference content that must be freshly
regenerated each time changes are required.  Once it is established
that the %insert always begins at an inode, we can reason further
about the sequence of events that follow by considering some of the
node oriented invariants for CTRIEs specified variously in the
academic literature.  First, it has been clearly defined that an INODE
structure may only reference three kinds of structure that we
collectively refer to as MAIN-NODES.  These are the three potential
cases which we will consider next.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider first the TNODE. If indeed we follow an INODE and
discover it directly leads us to a TNODE, or 'Tomb Node'. This tells
us, first, that we have arrived at a dead-end, second that we must
assist with the 'compression' of this arc by invoking the <code>CLEAN</code>
operation on the tombed INODE's parent.  Finally, there is nothing
further we can do so we THROW to :RESTART.</p></li>
<li><p>If traverse the INODE and arrive at an LNODE, we are also at the
end of the ARC, but if it is due to hash collision then the algorithm
then indeed it may be correct.  In this case we attempt to 'insert'
ourself in te LNODE chain and then invoke INODE mutate to atomic
commit and then THROW to :RESTART</p></li>
<li><p>As a simple instance of the general case, we may arrive at a CNODE
with vacant arc that represents the index specified by the bits of our
KEY's hash code that are active for this level within the ctrie.  When
this is the case, we construct a replacement CNODE augmented with our
key/value pair as an SNODE LEAF at the physical position within the
CNODES storage vector appropriately translated from the logical arc
index as described by the documentation of the functions
<code>FLAG-ARC-POSITION</code> and <code>FLAG-VECTOR</code> If we successfully mutate the
parent inode by completing an atomic replacement of the old cnode with
the one we constructed, then our insertion has succeeded and we return
the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in order to indicate
our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.</p></li>
<li><p>If we find the logical index of our 'arc' in this CNODE is not
empty and available as we did above, there are exactly two other
possibly find there; we know this because it is required to be a
BRANCH-NODE -- either an snode leaf storage or an inode referencing a
MAIN-NODE that represents the next layer of the CTRIE.  We describe
various posible cases and the define a procedure specified for each
below.</p></li>
<li><p>If we find that the node PRESENT at this index is an INODE, then
this is the simplest of the possible cases.  Conceptually, what we
intend to do is continue to follow our arc, descending to the next
level of the CTRIE structure that is referenced by that inode.  In
practice, however, we are required to consider the possibility that
the generational descriptor object the inode contains may not be
consistent with STARTGEN, which is the one current in the root INODE
of this CTRIE.  This may be the case, for example, as the result of
some past cloning/snapshot operation if we are the first since then to
traverse this inode. (Remember that the refresh of generational
descriptor occurs lazily on an as-needed basis in order to avoid
overhead incurred by eager traversals which often turn out to have
been unnecessary).  In consideration of this we proceeed as follows: -
If the inode generational descriptor is consistent with STARTGEN, we
simply continue along our arc by recursively invoking <code>%insert</code> on
that INODE.  If that function call returns successfully with a VALUE,
then the insertion was successful, and we also then return, passing
along that value.  Thus the result is communicated back through the
caller chain, eventually arriving back as the result of the original
CTRIE-PUT entry-point.  - Otherwise if the generational descriptor is
not consistent with STARTGEN we attempt an atomic <code>INODE-MUTATE</code> on
the PARENT INODE of this CNODE that effects the replacement of that
inode within it by one FRESHLY CREATED by <code>REFRESH</code> and ensured to be
consistent with STARTGEN.  If this succeeds, we invoke %insert
recusively and proceed in the same manner, since, effectively, we are
now in a state equivalent to the one described above.  - If the
INODE-MUTATE of the prior step did NOT succeed, then we are out of
options and throw to :RESTART the insertion process from the beginning
all over again.</p></li>
<li><p>If we find that the node PRESENT at this index is an SNODE,
then our situation becomes a little bit more complex and
there are a few more contingencies we must be prepared to
address.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, looking at the simplest first, when an insert
operation encounters a leaf-node somewhere along the descent of it's
'own' arc, one potential case is that it found the node it was
looking for -- one that contains a key that satisfies the test
predicate defined for the dynamic extent of the current operation,
<code>CTEQUAL,</code> when compared to the <code>KEY</code> currently being <code>%INSERTED.</code>
If the equality test is satisfied then the VALUE that node maps
should be updated with the one of the present insertion.  The steps
to effect the update are very similar to those of step 5, however We
construct a replacement CNODE augmented with our key/value pair as a
replacement SNODE in the SAME physical position as the one we have
found -- refer to the documentation for the function <code>CNODE-UPDATED</code>
for additional specifics on the internal details that describe this
operation.  If we successfully mutate the parent inode by completing
an atomic replacement of the old cnode with the one we constructed,
then our update has succeeded and we return the range value now
successfully mapped by KEY in order to indicate our success.
Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.</p></li>
<li><p>In some circumstances, we encounter a node on our arc whose
hash code bits have matched that of the current key of this
insertion for all of the lower order bits that have been consumed so
far, up to the current depth, but that (as opposed to step 9) does
not satisfy <code>CTEQUAL.</code> and so is NOT a candidiate for update
replacement.  Except in very vare circumstances, there will be some
depth at which the active bits of its hash code will indeed be
distinct from our own, and at that point a CNODE can be constructed
that will proprerly contain both it and an snode mapping the
key/value of the current insertion.  This means we must ENTEND the
ctrie as many layers as needed to get to that depth, inserting
CNODES and INODES at each step along the way.  Now, we will first
describe the 'edge' case where we have encounted the 'rare
circumstance.' If we perform this process and arrive at a depth
where all 32 hash code bits have been consumed and, indeed, these
two unequal keys are the result of a 'hash code collision' In order
that we preserve correct operation, we respond in this case by
chaining these key/value SNODES into a linked list of LNODES.
Therefore, they can share the same arc index and when we encounter
such a thing during future traversals, we can accomodate the
collision using simple linear search and a few basic LNODE utility
functions such as <code>LNODE-INSERTED</code> <code>LNODE-REMOVED</code> <code>LNODE-SEARCH</code>
<code>LNODE-LENGTH</code> and the list constructor <code>ENLIST.</code> Once we have
<code>ENLIST</code>ed the colliding SNODES, we create a new INODE pointing to
that list, and then attempt atomic replacement of the CNODE above
with one we extend to contain that INODE.  If we do successfully
mutate the prior CNODES parent INODE resulting in its replacement
with the CNODE we constructed, then our insert has succeeded and we
return the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in order to
indicate our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, let us return to those intermediate steps, mentioned
above, to specify the means by which we perform the level-by-level
extension of a given arc to accommodate both the above case of hash
collision as well as the more common one when the reason for
extension is simply to accomodate normal growth capacity and
allocation.  In both cases, though, the extensions are performed for
the same initiating cause -- to accomodate the collision of leaf
node keys resident at lower levels of the structure.  Depending on
the similarity of two colliding hash keys, the extension process may
not be resolved with a single iteration.  In the case of full
collisiion, described above, the extension process will recur, up to
a maximum depth of <code>(32/W)</code> levels, at which point an L-NODE chain
will be created.  At each iteration, a new INODE is created,
pointing to a new CNODE containing one of our conflictung pairs.
Then, <code>%INSERT</code> is attempted on that INODE and this process recurs.
Once this cycle of insert/extend completes, each INODE/CNODE pair is
returned to the parent -- the entire newly created structure
eventually returning to the point of original conflicts whre the
extension cycle began.  If we successfully mutate the parent inode
by completing an atomic replacement of the old cnode with the one
that begins this newly built structue, then our update has succeeded
and we return the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in
order to indicate our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART</p></li>

<p>The general concept of the procedure for finding a given key within

  follows: If the internal node is at level <code>L</code> then the W bits of the
  hashcode starting from position <code>W * L</code> are used as a logical index
  into the vector of <code>2^W</code> arcs that can possibly be represented
  within that node (see <code>FLAG</code> and <code>FLAG-VECTOR</code>). This logical index
  is then transformed into a physical index that denotes a specific
  position locating this arc relative to all other arcs currently
  present in the node (see <code>FLAG-ARC-POSITION</code>.  In this way, storage
  within the node need not be allocated for representation of empty
  arc positions. At all times the invariant is maintained that the
  number of arcs allocated within a given CNODE is equal to the
  Hamming-Weight of its BITMAP -- i.e., the number of nonzero bits
  present (see <code>CL:LOGCOUNT</code>). The arc at this calculated relative
  position is then followed, and the process repeated until arrival at
  a leaf-node or empty arc position.  Locating a given key becomes
  substantially more complicated in the actual lock-free concurrent

  Calling <code>(NAME key)</code> returns the value mapped to key, or <code>NIL</code> just
  as if by <code>(CTRIE-GET ctrie-name key).</code> Analogously when used as a
  setf-able place such as by <code>(setf (NAME key) value)</code> it has the
  equivalent behavior to the operation <code>(CTRIE-PUT ctrie-name key
  value).</code> Use of this type of binding technique has some really
  convenient effects that I've quickly started to become quite fond
  of.  One such idiom, for example, <code>(mapcar MY-CTRIE '(key1 key2 key3
  key4 ...))</code> returns a list containing all the mapped values
  corresponding to the respective keys.  One additional feature that
  I've found extremely useful is included <em>under the hood:</em> Invoking
  MY-CTRIE on an object of type FUNCTION will not search the ctrie for
  an entry having that function ast its key, but will instead APPLY
  that function to the actual CTRIE structure wrapped within the
  closure.  Thus, <code>(MY-CTRIE #'identity)</code> will return the underlying
  ctrie as just an ordinary instance of a CTRIE STRUCTURE.<br>
  There are many other functions this is handy with, like
  <code>(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-size)</code> <code>(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-to-hashtable)</code>
  etc.  Some additional examples are provided below.</p>
